Description: Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface,
 designed in a single thin weight. It is a display face that features
 both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary
 ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic
 alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than itâ€™s
 neo-grotesque inspired default character set.
 It is released under the SIL Open Font License.
